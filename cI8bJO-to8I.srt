1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,150
I took a bike trip to Xinjiang in 2019.

2
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:15,075
Though fun from riding was the main motive then,

3
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:18,675
this thousand-mile trip to Xinjiang was for something totally different.

4
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,700
There was a piece from Buzzfeed a while back,

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:27,900
supposedly locating many concentration camps in Xinjiang using satellite imagery.

6
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,375
But due to Chinese government policies,

7
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:34,850
it's now very difficult for foreign journalists to report in Xinjiang.

8
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:36,675
I thought,

9
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:38,000
"Foreign journalists can't enter,

10
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,525
but I can."

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,400
Besides, the aim of this series of films was

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,750
to record meaningful things.

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,775
I won't just eat, drink and be merry.

14
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:52,350
There is only satellite imagery on the website.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,775
Where the marked buildings specifically are,

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,575
How they really look,

17
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:58,775
And how their surroudings are -

18
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,700
I returned to Xinjiang with those doubts.

19
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,900
I encounter two checkpoints right off the 哈密市東郊的高速.

20
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,650
The first is expected,

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,150
but I don't foresee another police check at a village junction.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,375
Tourists aren't usually here

23
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:18,175
so I initially don't turn in

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,275
visiting the corner shop instead

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,125
Here, I pretend to be a tourist buying things.

26
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:26,550
But the police officer doesn't stop me.

27
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,200
He's obviously not interested in my car with inter-provincial plates.

28
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,600
This side street runs parallel to the Lianhuo Expressway

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,625
with many fields and farmhouses alongside.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,800
Because the Mapbox imagery was captured before 2017,

31
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,850
and ones found on Baidu are medium-res imagery from faraway,

32
00:01:50,825 --> 00:01:55,125
I can only rely on some obvious, unchanging characteristics.

33
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,350
to locate them on normal road maps.

34
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:05,425
The first gray target to be filmed is here in North Village (北村).

35
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,425
There is a brand new yet narrow paved road

36
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:11,575
that is however not shown on Baidu maps.

37
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,600
The asphalt road seems quite suspicious,

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,550
as most roads of this width in Xinjiang are made of dirt.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,375
Cotton occupies the surroudings.

40
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,525
A pink building lies in the distance.

41
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,100
seemingly out of place among the surrouding farmhouses.

42
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,075
But closed-off windows and wire fences aren't seen by this building,

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,700
and it's a gray target.

44
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,175
I don't observe closely,

45
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,875
only counting it as something suspicious.

46
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,100
I don't dare go too near

47
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,300
as I was quite anxious,

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,775
learning from the last drone incident in Tibet.

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,775
I don't want to run right into the police the first time filming,

50
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:51,150
so my movement is very cautious.

51
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:55,025
And another note:

52
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,975
I haven't recorded any on-scene commentary during the whole course

53
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,425
because of safety concerns.

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,700
Since if I recorded a piece of commentary,

55
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,575
"This is a concentration camp in ... in Xinjiang",

56
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:08,200
and were then stopped by police to check the footage,

57
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,100
then I myself would be in a concentration camp.

58
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,100
Going west towards Kumul City on country roads,

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,675
passing by Kumul Train Station,

60
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,025
I arrive at Advance (前進) Avenue and August First North (八一北) Road.

61
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,600
Here is a yellow target.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,350
The garden to the east is easily distinguishable.

63
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,325
The target lies to the west.

64
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:40,775
Only after passing the intersection do I notice this being the Kumul Compulsory Drug Qurantine Treatment Centre,

65
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,250
neighboured by an apartment complex.

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,800
The 戒毒所 is not marked on Baidu Maps.

67
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,050
All windows are closed off.

68
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,975
There is also barbed wire atop the walls.

69
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,250
The facilities here are totally capable of being used as a concentration camp.

70
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,675
But as the data from Mapbox is way too old,

71
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:03,700
being much different to the present situation.

72
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,175
So it can be considered likely, but not certain.

73
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:08,725
The "Drug Treatment Centre" lies on the yellow target.

74
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:13,800
There is a red target near Beijiao (北郊) Road in Kumul,

75
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,825
adjacent to 康和雅居社區.

76
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,125
Before driving into this small alleyway,

77
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,425
I first buy some stuff in the shop adjacent.

78
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:38,425
The gate shield says "Thirteenth Division Detention Centre" -

79
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,975
a government facility, it seems.

80
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:41,425
Cameras are everywhere.

81
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,075
I don't at all dare exiting the car to film.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,550
I initially want to exit through the road's other end,

83
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,675
but find no way.

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,050
There is also barbed wire on the wall opposite the detention centre.

85
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,325
I can't risk staying longer,

86
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,475
pretending to have gone the wrong way, and leave.

87
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:59,675
This detention centre is also not marked on Baidu Maps.

88
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,275
On the second day, I head north from 天山,

89
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,825
first arriving in 木壘哈薩克自治縣.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,625
On satellite imagery, I notice two targets slightly far from the road.

91
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,400
The other side are fields without much cover.

92
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:24,850
I think it's convenient to film,

93
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,525
but notice, as I near the centre of the fields,

94
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,425
it's prone to attracting people's attention -

95
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,125
not an optimal filming position.

96
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,700
I then try filming from another positiont

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,600
Guard towers and barbed wire are after all visible,

98
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,375
matching the yellow target's description.

99
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:52,200
But the precise locations of the two targets on the road map can't be confirmed.

100
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,300
At last, I head north from 人民南路.

101
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,075
Here lies 有農牧民培訓學校.

102
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:11,325
with "Vocational Training Centre" written on the wall

103
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:12,825
and barbed wire atop the walls,

104
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,775
which match characteristics of the gray targets.

105
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:18,575
Further up the road, a shield to the side says "Vocational Training Centre".

106
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:21,950
This should be the location of the watchtowers shown just then.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,375
And then passing a health centre,

108
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,900
which is marked on Baidu Maps.

109
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:30,175
But neither the training centre nor detention centre is.

110
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,200
According to the above observations,

111
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,525
these two targets should be 木壘縣 Detention Centre and 農牧民培訓學校.

112
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:41,575
Going west towards 達吉木薩爾縣,

113
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,200
there is a yellow target,

114
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,950
quite recognisable on satellite maps,

115
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,125
lying on the north-west corner of Xiyu (西域) Road and West People's (人民西) Road.

116
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,700
It's nothingness on Baidu Maps,

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,050
but actually 吉木薩爾縣 Detention Centre.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,125
Because of the tall walls,

119
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:03,375
only the walls and guardtowers can be filmed.

120
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,550
There are three targets in 阜康市 to the west.

121
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:27,625
Let's first visit this dark red target.

122
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,525
I carefully compare the blurry Baidu satellite imagery and Mapbox data,

123
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:35,625
confirming this location to be likely to

124
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:39,725
the northwest of G335國道寧朔路 and 南華路.

125
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,425
But it's not found nearby,

126
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,275
only an abandoned yard.

127
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,550
So either I'm wrong and can't find the place,

128
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:51,700
or the BFN website is wrong.

129
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,300
Going a bit further west along the G335 National Road,

130
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,400
there is a north-south unnamed road,

131
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:03,500
lying west of the Y109 Village Road.

132
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:07,675
Things like "軍墾農場" and "水磨新村" are marked on Baidu Maps.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,650
The other two targets in Fukang are north of this unnamed road.

134
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:17,025
Barbed wires and watchtowers are clearly visible.

135
00:08:17,225 --> 00:08:19,500
This should be the Fukang Detention Centre.

136
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,250
There are many targets in and around Urumqi.

137
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,400
I only visit four of them.

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,050
Three northern ones are north of 城北大道 and 東站路.

139
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,700
There is the marking "Urumqi市第二教育矯治局" on Baidu Maps.

140
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,425
This so-called 矯治局 actually also has a barb-wired courtyard.

141
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:07,575
There are surveilliance cameras once every few dozen metres.

142
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:09,650
To ensure filming quality,

143
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,575
I have to put on my backpack and strap on my camera.

144
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,925
This backpack mades me look unnatural.

145
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:17,700
Why would tourists come here?

146
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,150
I could only pray that no guards notice me.

147
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,841
After walking around, I notice:

148
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:25,850
There are not only three places walled off with barbed-wire.

149
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:06,125
I then drive once more around,

150
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,000
noticing a vegetable-tranport vehicle parked in front of a concentration camp.

151
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,025
Going further north,

152
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:17,700
passing an entrance of 第二矯治局

153
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,150
a strigently iron-fenced gate is seen.

154
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:22,650
So the 教育矯治局 is highly likely

155
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:26,325
to be also used as a low-security concentration camp. 

156
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,825
Northwards, there is a road running east to west

157
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,450
which isn't marked on Baidu Maps.

158
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:33,575
The street sign says Gaoke (高科) Road.

159
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,225
There are multiple large concentration areas south of this street,

160
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:48,600
all with guarded watchtowers.

161
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,400
高科路 is approximately 1.1 kilometres, measured using Baidu Maps.

162
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:58,025
Judging by the scale, many people are probably imprisoned here.

163
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,275
This is probably the largest concentration camp in Urumqi.

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,250
Note here the slogan on the roof:

165
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,550
The four characters, "Labour transformation", "cultural transformation", are faintly visible.

166
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:55,600
This red target south of Urumqi is actually Xishan (西山) Detention Centre.

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,625
Its location is clearly seen from the hilltop in Ya'shan (雅山) Park.

168
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,225
The characters "Fifth Captivity Area" stands atop a glass gate.

169
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,600
Glass rooftops protrude the buildings.

170
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:15,375
Inmates can presumably only breathe fresh air indoors.

171
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,100
Leaving Urumqi for Dawan Cheng,

172
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:58,450
there is an unremarkable small street off the G312 National Road.

173
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,125
Passing a railway bridge,

174
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,275
the road quickly becomes gravel.

175
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,500
I once again end up somewhere, where tourists shouldn't be.

176
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,575
Opposite the hill is a newly built, uncommissioned concentration camp.

177
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:30,700
As no cover is nearby, I can only crawl up the hill and film,

178
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,125
not risking getting caught by standing.

179
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,075
There is also another target in Dawan Cheng.

180
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,825
Presumably a detention centre, but I don't visit.

181
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,950
I go to the eastern outskirts of Korla on the last day.

182
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,850
This here is nothingness on Baidu Maps,

183
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,775
but information from BFN shows multiple concentration camps.

184
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,850
Heading towards the G218 National Road from the Northern Ring Road,

185
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,925
a Party's Defence Army garrison first lies,

186
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,925
clearly visible on Mapbox satellite maps.

187
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:57,350
Two tanks also occupy the garrison,

188
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,000
resembling the model that ran people over at Tian'anmen.

189
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:00,975
It actually isn't.

190
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,325
There is more than one garrison around here.

191
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,125
The nearby buildings might be barracks,

192
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:09,825
or other facilities.

193
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,000
There are many military trucks parked in the yard,

194
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,175
with likely many Party's Defence Army troops stationed here.

195
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:19,900
Behind those barracks,

196
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:22,875
there are barb-wired walls with watchtowers farther in the distance.

197
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:25,175
There lies the concentration camp.

198
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,900
I initially want to go nearer,

199
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,800
but there is unfortunaly no way there.

200
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,900
The last stop, Karasahr City Centre, has two targets.

201
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:53,300
First arriving at the northern bank of the Kaidu River,

202
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,050
stopping by an unnamed road,

203
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,450
newly built walls and watchtowers are filmed.

204
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,250
There is also a ring of buildings near the concentration camp.

205
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:32,125
There is a yellow target here.

206
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:35,475
The concentration camp is hidden behind this big red gate,

207
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,675
not easily noticeable driving by on the road.

208
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:50,425
河對面橋頭的位置是另外一個灰色標記所在

209
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:54,475
在橋上就能看見高大的黃色建築

210
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,550
There are only walls without barbed-wire or watchtowers;

211
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,425
windows are also not barred -

212
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,550
like the pink houses first seen in Kumul.

213
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,300
Buildings marked gray don't seem to be concentration camps.

214
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,000
Those were my on-site observations.

215
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:16,475
Due to the limited time and far distance,

216
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:20,250
I only investigated a few selected targets.

217
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,625
Most importantly, I could only film very limited footage before the walls.

218
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:28,500
More data of the same category would be quite meaningless anyway.

219
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,325
There are already many reports over concentration camps in Xinjiang by foreign media.

220
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,700
The last time I motorcycled there, I asked the local Han people,

221
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,850
some revealing Uyghur people being dedicated elsewhere as cheap labour.

222
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:48,132
Those Uyghurs who don't want to snitch on their compatriots for the Chinese Government

223
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,275
are also lead into concentration camps for re-education.

224
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,950
The Uyghur language is not allowed in schools.

225
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:57,225
During the 2019 Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Movement,

226
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,475
Chinese Government-controlled police personell

227
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:03,625
dared to relentlessly beat and kill people in front of so many foreign journalists.

228
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,775
Therefore, in somewhere like Xinjiang, where foreign can't at all enter,

229
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,625
abuse of the Uyghur people by the Chinese Government is even more unimaginable.

230
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,000
One who doesn't wish to be enslaved also doesn't want others enslaved.

231
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,050
May the Chinese Government, the CCP, soon dissolve and step down,

232
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,525
end these crimes against humanity.
