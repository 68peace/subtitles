00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.150
I took a bike trip to Xinjiang in 2019.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:15.075
Though fun from riding was the main motive then,

00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:18.675
this thousand-mile trip to Xinjiang was for something totally different.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.700
There was a piece from Buzzfeed a while back,

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:27.900
supposedly locating many concentration camps in Xinjiang using satellite imagery.

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.375
But due to Chinese government policies,

00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:34.850
it's now very difficult for foreign journalists to report in Xinjiang.

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:36.675
I thought,

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:38.000
"Foreign journalists can't enter,

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:39.525
but I can."

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.400
Besides, the aim of this series of films was

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.750
to record meaningful things.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.775
I won't just eat, drink and be merry.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:52.350
There is only satellite imagery on the website.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.775
Where the marked buildings specifically are,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.575
How they really look,

00:00:57.025 --> 00:00:58.775
And how their surroudings are -

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.700
I returned to Xinjiang with those doubts.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.900
I encounter two checkpoints right off the 哈密市東郊的高速.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.650
The first is expected,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.150
but I don't foresee another police check at a village junction.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.375
Tourists aren't usually here

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:18.175
so I initially don't turn in

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.275
visiting the corner shop instead

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.125
Here, I pretend to be a tourist buying things.

00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:26.550
But the police officer doesn't stop me.

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:29.200
He's obviously not interested in my car with inter-provincial plates.

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:37.600
This side street runs parallel to the G20連霍高速,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.625
with many fields and farmhouses alongside.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.800
Because the Mapbox imagery was captured before 2017,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.850
and ones found on Baidu are medium-res imagery from faraway,

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:55.125
I can only rely on some obvious, unchanging characteristics.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:58.350
to locate them on normal road maps.

00:02:02.425 --> 00:02:05.425
The first gray target to be filmed is here in 北村.

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:09.425
There is a brand new yet narrow paved road

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:11.575
that is however not shown on Baidu maps.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.600
The asphalt road seems quite suspicious,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.550
as most roads of this width in Xinjiang are made of dirt.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.375
Cotton occupies the surroudings.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.525
A pink building lies in the distance.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.100
seemingly out of place among the surrouding farmhouses.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.075
But closed-off windows and wire fences aren't seen by this building,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.700
and it's a gray target.

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:34.175
I don't observe closely,

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.875
only counting it as something suspicious.

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:39.100
I don't dare go too near

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.300
as I was quite anxious.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.775
畢竟有上次西藏無人機事件作為前車之鑒

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.775
I don't want to run right into the police the first time filming,

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:51.150
so my movement is very cautious.

00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:55.025
And another note:

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:58.975
I haven't recorded any on-scene commentary during the whole course

00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:00.425
because of safety concerns.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.700
Since if I recorded a piece of commentary,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.575
"This is a concentration camp in ... in Xinjiang",

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:08.200
and were then stopped by police to check the footage

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.100
then I myself would be in a concentration camp

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.100
沿著鄉村公路一直向西前往哈密市區

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.675
經過哈密火車站

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.025
來到前進大道和八一北路

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.600
Here is a yellow target.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.350
東側的碧綠花園在衛星地圖上非常容易辨認

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.325
The target lies to the west

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:40.775
過了路口才發現這裏是哈密市強制隔離戒毒所

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.250
neighboured by an apartment complex.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.800
The 戒毒所 is not marked on Baidu Maps.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.050
All windows are closed off.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.975
院內圍牆上還有鐵絲網

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.250
The facilities here are totally capable of being used as a concentration camp.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.675
But as the data from Mapbox is way too old,

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:03.700
being much different to the present situation.

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:06.175
So it can be considered likely, but not certain.

00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:08.725
The 戒毒所 lies on the yellow target.

00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:13.800
There is a red target near 哈密市北郊路這裏,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.825
adjacent to 康和雅居社區.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.125
Before driving into this small alleyway,

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:25.425
I first buy some stuff in the shop adjacent.

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:38.425
The gate shield says 第十三師看守所 -

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.975
a government facility, it seems.

00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:41.425
Cameras are everywhere.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.075
I don't at all dare exiting the car to film.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.550
I initially want to exit through the road's other end,

00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:48.675
but find no way.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.050
There is also barbed wire on the wall opposite the 看守所.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.325
[copyedit] I can't risk staying longer,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.475
pretending to have gone the wrong way, and leave.

00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:59.675
This 看守所 is also not marked on Baidu Maps.

00:05:11.725 --> 00:05:13.275
On the second day, I head north from 天山,

00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:15.825
first arriving in 木壘哈薩克自治縣.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.625
On satellite imagery, I notice two targets slightly far from the road.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.400
The other side are fields without much cover.

00:05:23.575 --> 00:05:24.850
I think it's convenient to film,

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.525
but notice, as I near the centre of the fields,

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.425
it's prone to attracting people's attention -

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.125
not an optimal filming position.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.700
I then try filming from another positiont

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.600
Guard towers and barbed wire are after all visible,

00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:48.375
matching the yellow target's description.

00:05:48.725 --> 00:05:52.200
But the precise locations of the two targets on the road map can't be confirmed.

00:05:59.175 --> 00:06:01.300
At last, I head north from 人民南路.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.075
Here lies 有農牧民培訓學校.

00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:11.325
with "Vocational Training Centre" written on the wall

00:06:11.825 --> 00:06:12.825
and barbed wire atop the walls,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.775
which match characteristics of the gray targets.

00:06:15.325 --> 00:06:18.575
Further up the road, a shield to the side says "Vocational Training Centre".

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.950
This should be the location of the watchtowers shown just then.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.375
And then passing a 衛生院,

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.900
which is marked on Baidu Maps.

00:06:28.275 --> 00:06:30.175
But neither the training centre nor 看守所 is.

00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:33.200
According to the above observations,

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:37.525
these two targets should be 木壘縣看守所 and 農牧民培訓學校.

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:41.575
Going west towards 達吉木薩爾縣,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.200
there is a yellow target,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.950
quite recognisable on satellite maps,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.125
lying on the north-west corner of 西域路 and 人民西路.

00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:54.700
It's nothingness on Baidu Maps,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.050
but actually 吉木薩爾縣拘留所.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.125
Because of the tall walls,

00:07:01.225 --> 00:07:03.375
only the walls and guardtowers can be filmed.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.550
There are three targets in 阜康市 to the west.

00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:27.625
Let's first visit this dark red target.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.525
I carefully compare the blurry Baidu satellite imagery and Mapbox data,

00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:35.625
confirming this location to be likely to

00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:39.725
the northwest of G335國道寧朔路 and 南華路交叉口.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.425
But it's not found nearby,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.275
only an abandoned yard.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.550
So either I'm wrong and can't find the place,

00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:51.700
or the BFN website is wrong.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.300
Going a bit further west along the G335 National Road,

00:07:57.375 --> 00:07:59.400
there is a north-south unnamed road,

00:08:00.575 --> 00:08:03.500
lying west of the Y109 Village Road.

00:08:04.325 --> 00:08:07.675
Things like "軍墾農場" and "水磨新村" are marked on Baidu Maps.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.650
The other two targets in 阜康市 are north of this unnamed road.

00:08:13.725 --> 00:08:17.025
Barbed wires and watchtowers are clearly visible.

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:19.500
This should be 阜康市拘留所.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.250
There are many targets in and around Urumqi.

00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:52.400
I only visit four of them.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.050
Three northern ones are north of 城北大道 and 東站路.

00:08:56.575 --> 00:09:00.700
There is the marking "Urumqi市第二教育矯治局" on Baidu Maps.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.425
This so-called 矯治局 actually also has a barb-wired courtyard.

00:09:05.175 --> 00:09:07.575
There are surveilliance cameras once every few dozen metres.

00:09:08.075 --> 00:09:09.650
To ensure filming quality,

00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:12.575
I have to put on my backpack and strap on my camera.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.925
This backpack mades me look unnatural.

00:09:16.175 --> 00:09:17.700
Why would tourists come here?

00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:21.150
I could only pray that no guards notice me.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.841
After walking around, I notice:

00:09:22.841 --> 00:09:25.850
There are not only three places walled off with barbed-wire.

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:06.125
I then drive once more around,

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.000
noticing a vegetable-tranport vehicle parked in front of a concentration camp.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.025
Going further north,

00:10:15.075 --> 00:10:17.700
passing an entrance of 第二矯治局

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.150
a strigently iron-fenced gate is seen.

00:10:20.575 --> 00:10:22.650
So the 教育矯治局 is highly likely

00:10:22.725 --> 00:10:26.325
to be also used as a low-security concentration camp. 

00:10:27.725 --> 00:10:29.825
Northwards, there is a road running east to west

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.450
which isn't marked on Baidu Maps.

00:10:31.725 --> 00:10:33.575
The street sign says 高科路.

00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:46.225
There are multiple large concentration areas south of this street,

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:48.600
all with guarded watchtowers.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.400
高科路 is approximately 1.1 kilometres, measured using Baidu Maps.

00:10:54.675 --> 00:10:58.025
Judging by the scale, many people are probably imprisoned here.

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:03.275
This is probably the largest concentration camp in Urumqi.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.250
Note here the slogan on the roof:

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:15.550
The four characters, "Labour transformation", "cultural transformation", are faintly visible.

00:12:51.575 --> 00:12:55.600
This red target south of Urumqi is actually Xishan (西山) 拘留所.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.625
Its location is clearly seen from the hilltop in Ya'shan (雅山) Park.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.225
The characters "Fifth Captivity Area" stands atop a glass gate.

00:13:10.575 --> 00:13:12.600
Glass rooftops protrude the buildings.

00:13:12.775 --> 00:13:15.375
Inmates can presumably only breathe fresh air indoors.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.100
Leaving Urumqi for 達阪城區,

00:13:55.775 --> 00:13:58.450
there is an unremarkable small street off the G312 National Road.

00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:10.125
Passing a railway bridge,

00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:12.275
the road quickly becomes gravel.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.500
I once again end up somewhere, where tourists shouldn't be.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.575
Opposite the hill is a newly built, uncommissioned concentration camp.

00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:30.700
As no cover is nearby, I can only crawl up the hill and film,

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.125
not risking getting caught by standing.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.075
There is also another target in the 達阪 area.

00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:10.825
Presumably a detention centre, but I don't visit.

00:15:12.825 --> 00:15:14.950
I go to 庫爾勒市東郊 on the last day.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.850
This here is nothingness on Baidu Maps,

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.775
but information from BFN shows multiple concentration camps.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.850
Heading towards the G218 National Road from the Northern Ring Road,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.925
a Party's Defence Army garrison first lies,

00:15:33.225 --> 00:15:35.925
clearly visible on Mapbox satellite maps.

00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:57.350
Two tanks also occupy the garrison,

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.000
resembling the model that ran people over at Tian'anmen.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:00.975
It actually isn't.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.325
There is more than one garrison around here.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.125
The nearby buildings might be barracks,

00:16:08.275 --> 00:16:09.825
or other facilities.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.000
There are many military trucks parked in the yard,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.175
with likely many Party's Defence Army troops stationed here.

00:16:18.475 --> 00:16:19.900
Behind those barracks,

00:16:20.025 --> 00:16:22.875
there are barb-wired walls with watchtowers farther in the distance.

00:16:23.225 --> 00:16:25.175
There lies the concentration camp.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:26.900
I initially want to go nearer,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.800
but there is unfortunaly no way there.

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.900
The last stop, 焉耆 city centre, has two targets.

00:16:51.425 --> 00:16:53.300
First arriving at the northern bank of the 開都河,

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.050
stopping by an unnamed road,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.450
newly built walls and watchtowers are filmed.

00:17:15.275 --> 00:17:17.250
There is also a ring of buildings near the concentration camp.

00:17:30.825 --> 00:17:32.125
There is a yellow target here.

00:17:32.475 --> 00:17:35.475
The concentration camp is hidden behind this big red gate,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.675
not easily noticeable driving by on the road.

00:17:47.175 --> 00:17:50.425
河對面橋頭的位置是另外一個灰色標記所在

00:17:51.725 --> 00:17:54.475
在橋上就能看見高大的黃色建築

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.550
There are only walls without barbed-wire or watchtowers;

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.425
windows are also not barred -

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.550
like the pink houses first seen in 哈密.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.300
Buildings marked gray don't seem to be concentration camps.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.000
Those were my on-site observations.

00:18:14.775 --> 00:18:16.475
Due to the limited time and far distance,

00:18:16.475 --> 00:18:20.250
I only investigated a few selected targets.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:25.625
Most importantly, I could only film very limited footage before the walls.

00:18:26.025 --> 00:18:28.500
More data of the same category would be quite meaningless anyway.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.325
There are already many reports over concentration camps in Xinjiang by foreign media.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.700
The last time I motorcycled there, I asked the local Han people,

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:43.850
some revealing Uyghur people being dedicated elsewhere as cheap labour.

00:18:44.075 --> 00:18:48.132
Those Uyghurs who don't want to snitch on their compatriots for the Chinese Government

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.275
are also lead into concentration camps for re-education.

00:18:51.125 --> 00:18:53.950
The Uyghur language is not allowed in schools.

00:18:54.275 --> 00:18:57.225
During the 2019 Hong Kong Anti-Extradition Movement,

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.475
Chinese Government-controlled police personell

00:18:59.475 --> 00:19:03.625
dared to relentlessly beat and kill people in front of so many foreign journalists.

00:19:04.575 --> 00:19:07.775
Therefore, in somewhere like Xinjiang, where foreign can't at all enter,

00:19:08.125 --> 00:19:11.625
abuse of the Uyghur people by the Chinese Government is even more unimaginable.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.000
One who doesn't wish to be enslaved also doesn't want others enslaved.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.050
May the Chinese Government, the CCP, soon dissolve and step down,

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.525
end these crimes against humanity.
